# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge.

We pledge to make our community welcoming, accessible, and safe for everyone, and to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion, regardless of age or generation; body size or personal appearance; visible or invisible disability; neurodiversity; ethnicity, race, caste, or color; gender identity or expression; sex traits or identity; sexual orientation; national origin or citizenship; education level; or socio-economic status. 

## Our Community Standards.

We strive to be a diverse, equitable, just, and inclusive community. We recognize that achieving this goal requires more than good intentions. The impact of our behavior and our treatment of one another define our community's true culture.

### Examples of positive, desirable behavior include:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful toward differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility for, and learning from, our mistakes.
* Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
* Seeking out moments of learning and growth.
* Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our community.

### Examples of negative, undesirable behavior include:

* Violating explicitly expressed personal boundaries.
* Making sexual advances, or using sexualized language or imagery.
* Engaging in public or private harassment.
* Making insulting or pejorative comments or attacks.
* Sharing someone's personal or private information without their permission.
* Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.

## Enforcing Our Standards.

### Scope.

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants in all community spaces. It also applies to anyone representing our community in other spaces.

### Reporting Violations.

To report a violation, contact the enforcement team via [INSERT REPORTING EMAIL ADDRESS HERE].

The enforcement team will strive to protect the privacy of the reporter. They will review and investigate reports in a prompt and fair manner. A confirmed violation of our community standards warrants an enforcement action.

### Enforcement Guidelines.
How we enforce our community standards also reflects our culture. These are examples of remedies based on the severity of a violation's impact on an individual and on our community. Some remedies may be cumulative.

#### 1. Correction.
_Community impact_: Use of unsuitable or unprofessional language or behavior.

_Remedy_: A private warning and explanation of why the behavior was problematic. The offender may be asked to make a personal or public apology.

#### 2. Warning.

_Community impact_: A violation involving a single incident or series of actions.

_Remedy_: A warning with penalties for continued behavior. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban.

_Community impact_: A serious or sustained violation of community standards.

_Remedy_: A temporary ban on interactions with community members. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban.

_Community impact_: Showing a pattern of violation of community standards. Sustained unsuitable behavior toward a person or class of people.

_Remedy_: A permanent ban from all participation in the community.

### Discretion in Enforcement Actions.

The guidelines provided above are not exhaustive. The enforcement team may decide upon other remedies as needed. We prioritize the well-being of the person who experienced harm. We favor repair over punishment. 

Discretion is appropriate in cases including those where:

* There is a lack of contrition or commitment to remedying harm.
* There is no remedy for the harm that has occurred. 
* Rejoining the community is likely to perpetuate harm.
