# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In order to create an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and
maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

* age
* body size
* disability
* ethnicity
* sex characteristics
* gender identity and expression
* level of experience
* education
* socio-economic status
* nationality
* personal appearance
* race
* religion
* sexual identity and orientation

## Our Standards

You can contribute to creating a positive environment in many ways. For example
participants can:

* use welcoming and inclusive language
* be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* accept constructive criticism gracefully
* focus on what is best for the community
* show empathy towards other community members

You must not:

* use sexualized language or imagery
* make unwelcome sexual advances
* troll, and make insulting or derogatory comments
* make personal or political attacks
* harass others, in public or private
* publish others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* engage in any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and we are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:

* comments
* commits
* code
* wiki edits
* issues
* other contributions that are not aligned to this code of conduct

We also reserve the right to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for
other behaviors we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when you are representing the project or community. For example you may be:

* using an official project e-mail address
* posting via an official social media account
* acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event

Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation of a project.

## Enforcement

You should report any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
behavior to the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. The project team will
review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain the
confidentiality of the reporter of an incident. We may post further details of
specific enforcement policies separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this code of conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent consequences. These will be determined by
members of the project's leadership.
