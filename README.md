## Translating

We're always looking for new localizations of the Contributor Covenant and are thankful to the volunteers who spend their time on translations.

If you are interested in doing a translation, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and make a branch for your translation.
1. If it's a new language, add it to `config.toml`,
  with a localized name and language code/optional region (e.g. `pt` or `pt-br`). See the [list of ISO 639-2 language codes here](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php)
1. Create a markdown file with your translation in `version/2/0/code_of_conduct.LANGUAGECODE.md`. (Underscores, not hyphens.)
1. Open a pull request.
1. We will put out a call to have one or more other native speakers review the translation.
1. Collaborate until the translation is satisfactory.
1. We will merge your translation!
1. HTML and plain text versions are automatically generated from your markdown file.
1. A link to your translation is automatically added to the translations page.
